Project Executive Summary:
This project utilizes the plotly library to generate heatmaps of a theoretical strategy using the implied probability calculated from a set of odds and the published 538 global soccer ELO model, spanning 2016 to 2018. Odds from oddsportal.com.
The resulting heatmaps show surprising profitability when the odds imply and 538's model both show a 50-60% chance of victory for home teams and 60-70% chance of victory for away teams. 

Instructions:
Download anaconda and or launch heatMaps.ipynb with jupytyer notebook. Ensure 1finaldata.csv (CSV) is in the same file directory.
Simply run all. heatMaps processes the data in the csv into the correct data structures necessary for heatmap visualization.
The visualizations should show significant profit in the 50-60% bin for home teams and 60-70% bucket for away teams.
